# Salon Appointment Scheduler Database Project

This project is part of the **FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification** course. It demonstrates the creation and management of a PostgreSQL database for a salon appointment scheduling system with an interactive bash script interface.

## üìã Project Overview

The Salon Appointment Scheduler project involves:

- Creating a PostgreSQL database to manage salon services and appointments
- Implementing a normalized database schema with proper relationships
- Building an interactive bash script for customer appointment booking
- Handling customer registration and appointment scheduling logic

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The database consists of three main tables with proper foreign key relationships:

!!! abstract "Database Schema"
    === "Services Table"
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE public.services (
            service_id integer NOT NULL,
            name character varying(255) NOT NULL
        );
        ```
            
        - **service_id**: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer
        - **name**: Service name (e.g., 'Potong Rambut', 'Cukur Jenggot')
      
    === "Customers Table"
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE public.customers (
            customer_id integer NOT NULL,
            phone character varying(255) NOT NULL,
            name character varying(255) NOT NULL
        );
        ```
            
        - **customer_id**: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer
        - **phone**: Unique customer phone number (serves as natural identifier)
        - **name**: Customer full name
      
    === "Appointments Table"
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE public.appointments (
            appointment_id integer NOT NULL,
            customer_id integer,
            service_id integer,
            "time" character varying(255)
        );
        ```
            
        - **appointment_id**: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer
        - **customer_id**: Foreign key referencing customers.customer_id
        - **service_id**: Foreign key referencing services.service_id
        - **time**: Appointment time (stored as text for flexibility)

Relationships

- `appointments.customer_id` ‚Üí `customers.customer_id`
- `appointments.service_id` ‚Üí `services.service_id`
- `customers.phone` has UNIQUE constraint for data integrity

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
fcc-rdb-salondb/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ salon.sh           # Interactive appointment booking script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ salon.sql          # Database schema and initial data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Project documentation
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

- Prerequisites
    - PostgreSQL installed and running
    - Bash shell environment
    - FreeCodeCamp development environment

- Database Setup
    1. Create the database:
    ```bash
    createdb salon
    ```

    2. Import the schema and data:
    ```bash
    psql -d salon -f salon.sql
    ```

- Running the Application
    Make the script executable and run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x salon.sh
    ./salon.sh
    ```

## üîß Application Features

- Interactive Menu System
    The salon.sh script provides a user-friendly interface with:

    **Welcome Screen:**
    ```
    ~~~~~ WAZZALON ~~~~~

    Welcome to Wazzalon, how can I help you?
    ```

    **Service Selection:**

    - Displays all available services with numbered options
    - Validates user input (numbers 1-5 only)
    - Handles invalid selections with appropriate error messages

    **Customer Management:**

    - Phone number-based customer lookup
    - Automatic new customer registration
    - Maintains customer data consistency

    **Appointment Booking:**

    - Service selection validation
    - Time input flexibility
    - Confirmation message with booking details

- Script Logic Flow

    1. Main Menu Function
        ```bash
        MAIN_MENU() {
        # Display feedback messages
        # Query and display available services
        # Handle service selection
        # Process customer information
        # Schedule appointment
        }
        ```

    2. Service Display
        - Queries services table for available options
        - Formats output as numbered list
        - Handles empty service scenarios

    3. Input Validation
        - **Service ID**: Validates numeric input (1-5 range)
        - **Phone Number**: Used as unique customer identifier
        - **Customer Registration**: Automatic for new customers

    4. Database Operations
        - **Customer Lookup**: `SELECT name FROM customers WHERE phone='$CUSTOMER_PHONE'`
        - **New Customer Insert**: `INSERT INTO customers(name, phone) VALUES('$CUSTOMER_NAME','$CUSTOMER_PHONE')`
        - **Appointment Booking**: `INSERT INTO appointments(customer_id, service_id, time) VALUES('$CUSTOMER_ID','$SERVICE_ID_SELECTED','$SERVICE_TIME')`

    ```

## üîç Technical Implementation Details

- Database Connection
    ```bash
    PSQL="psql -X --username=freecodecamp --dbname=salon --tuples-only -c"
    ```
    - Uses tuples-only mode for clean output
    - Connects with freecodecamp user
    - Targets salon database specifically

- Error Handling
    - **Invalid Service Selection**: "That's not a number"
    - **Service Not Found**: "I could not find that service. What would you like today?"
    - **Empty Services**: "Sorry, we dont have any service available right now"

- Data Processing
    - **String Trimming**: Uses `sed -r 's/^ *| *$//g'` to clean customer names
    - **Input Validation**: Regex pattern `^[1-5]+$` for service selection
    - **Conditional Logic**: Nested if-else statements for flow control

- Security Considerations
    - Uses parameterized queries through variables
    - Input validation prevents basic injection attempts
    - Phone number serves as natural unique identifier

## üèÜ Key Features

- Database Design
    - **Normalized Structure**: Separate entities for services, customers, and appointments
    - **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency
    - **Scalability**: Auto-incrementing IDs support unlimited records

- User Interface
    - **Intuitive Navigation**: Numbered menu system
    - **Error Recovery**: Invalid inputs return to main menu with helpful messages
    - **Personalization**: Uses customer names in confirmations

- Business Logic
    - **Customer Recognition**: Phone-based identification system
    - **Automatic Registration**: Seamless onboarding for new customers
    - **Flexible Scheduling**: Text-based time input allows various formats

## üìà Potential Extensions

Future enhancements could include:

- **Service Pricing**: Add cost information to services table
- **Appointment Duration**: Track service duration for scheduling
- **Staff Management**: Add stylists/employees table
- **Appointment Status**: Track confirmed, completed, cancelled appointments
- **Customer History**: Query past appointments and preferences
- **Time Validation**: Implement proper time format validation
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevent double-booking of time slots
