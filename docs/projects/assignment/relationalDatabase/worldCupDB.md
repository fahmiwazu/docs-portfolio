# World Cup Database Project

This project is part of the **FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification** course. It demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a PostgreSQL database containing World Cup tournament data from 2014 and 2018.

## 📋 Project Overview

The World Cup Database project involves:

- Creating a PostgreSQL database to store World Cup tournament data
- Implementing database schema with proper relationships
- Importing data from CSV files using shell scripts
- Writing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The database consists of two main tables:

!!! abstract "Database Schema"
    === "Teams Table"
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE public.teams (
           team_id integer NOT NULL,
           name character varying(255) NOT NULL
        );
        ```
  
        - **team_id**: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer
        - **name**: Unique team name (e.g., 'France', 'Croatia')

    === "Games Table"
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE public.games (
           game_id integer NOT NULL,
           winner_id integer NOT NULL,
           opponent_id integer NOT NULL,
           winner_goals integer NOT NULL,
           opponent_goals integer NOT NULL,
           year integer NOT NULL,
           round character varying(255) NOT NULL
        );
        ```
  
        - **game_id**: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer
        - **winner_id**: Foreign key referencing teams.team_id
        - **opponent_id**: Foreign key referencing teams.team_id
        - **winner_goals**: Number of goals scored by the winning team
        - **opponent_goals**: Number of goals scored by the opponent team
        - **year**: Tournament year (2014 or 2018)
        - **round**: Tournament round (Final, Semi-Final, Quarter-Final, etc.)
 
Relationships

- `games.winner_id` → `teams.team_id`
- `games.opponent_id` → `teams.team_id`

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── insert_data.sh      # Script to populate the database
├── queries.sh          # Script with predefined queries

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

- Prerequisites
   - PostgreSQL installed and running
   - Bash shell environment
   - CSV data file (games.csv)

- Database Setup

=== "Create the database"
      ```bash
      createdb worldcup
      ```

=== "Import the schema"
      ```bash
      psql -d worldcup -f worldcup.sql
      ```

- Data Import

=== "Run the data insertion script"
      ```bash
      ./insert_data.sh
      ```

      The script will:

      - Read data from `games.csv`
      - Insert unique team names into the teams table
      - Insert game records with proper foreign key relationships

## 🔧 Scripts Description

- insert_data.sh

      This script processes the CSV file and populates the database:

      **Key Features:**

      - Handles both test and production environments
      - Truncates existing data before insertion
      - Reads CSV line by line using IFS (Internal Field Separator)
      - Checks for existing teams before insertion
      - Maintains referential integrity

      **Logic Flow:**

      1. Truncate both tables to start fresh
      2. For each CSV row:
         - Check if winner team exists, insert if not
         - Check if opponent team exists, insert if not
         - Insert game record with team IDs

- Testing Your Implementation

    To verify your queries work correctly:
    
    1. **Run the script**:
       ```bash
       ./queries.sh
       ```
    
       2. **Compare outputs**: Match your results with the expected outputs above
    
       3. **Debug common issues**:
          - Ensure database is properly populated
          - Check for typos in SQL syntax
          - Verify table relationships are correct

- Performance Notes

    - Queries use indexed columns (primary/foreign keys) for optimal performance
    - JOIN operations are efficient due to proper relationship design
    - DISTINCT operations may be slower on larger datasets
