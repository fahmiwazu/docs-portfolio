# Valentino Artisan Coffee House API

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the Valentino Artisan Coffee House API by implementing test automation using Postman, ensuring comprehensive validation of functionality, performance, and security throughout the development lifecycle.

## Installation Guide
### Prerequisites
- **JavaScript**: Proficiency in JavaScript is essential for writing and executing test scripts in Postman. Understanding JavaScript will enable you to create complex test scenarios, handle asynchronous operations, and manipulate API responses effectively.

- **Postman**: Familiarity with Postman, a powerful tool for API development and testing, is crucial. Knowledge of how to create and organize collections, set up environments, write test scripts, and use Postmanâ€™s Collection Runner and Newman command-line tool is necessary for effective test automation.

- **Chai**: Experience with Chai, a popular assertion library used in conjunction with JavaScript, is important for validating test results. Chai provides a variety of assertion styles and methods that will help ensure the API responses meet expected criteria.

- **GitHub**: Proficiency with GitHub is required for version control and collaboration. Understanding how to create repositories, manage branches, and handle pull requests will facilitate effective teamwork and maintain the integrity of test automation scripts and related documentation.

## Project Assignment
### Assignment 1

**Task 1**

Add to the request **"Get API status"** a Postman test that verifies the status is 200.
Once you have established that the test is working as expected, duplicate the request and drag it inside the **"Assignment #1"** collection and put it in the **"API requests"** folder. Ensure the name of the request remains the same.

**Task 2**

Add to the request **"Get single product"** a script that parses the JSON response body. Log the value of the property "product-description" to the Postman console.
Once you have established that the script is working as expected, duplicate the request and drag it inside the **"Assignment #1"** collection and put it in the **"API requests"** folder. Ensure the name of the request remains the same.

**Task 3**

Add to the request **"Create a new order"** a script that parses the JSON response body and sets a Postman variable named orderId with the id of the order that was just created.
Once you have established that the script is working as expected, duplicate the request and drag it inside the **"Assignment #1"** collection and put it in the **"API requests"** folder. Ensure the name of the request remains the same.
